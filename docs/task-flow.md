## For example implement reports
1. Check if you need to provide changes to data layer, in this case we should create a new table.
2. Create migration if there is any changes.
3. Create entity (Model).
4. Create repository for this model if it's necessary.
5. Create servie with logic for this feature.
6. Create api (controller) for feature.

## Always check migrations before merge to main
